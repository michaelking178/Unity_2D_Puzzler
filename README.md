# Unity_2D_Puzzler
A simple, original 2D puzzle game where the player must use color combinations to progress.

I'm creating this game from scratch using my existing knowledge of Unity2D and C# (with a healthy dose of Google, of course).

Move through a labyrinth of locked doors that only respond to color. Use the Color Triggers wisely in your quest to find freedom. Watch out for traps though...
